<h2>Additional notes and issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeping Visual Studio Code updated brings many improvements for the team is actively improving its accessibility,</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio Code is based on Chrome Electron , which lets create standalone applications based on JavaScript and HTML components. Therefore, it behaves alot like a web application.</li>
<li>The editor is a large textarea field. The content of that textarea is updated by Visual Studio Code specifically to enable screen reader support. It is a temporary work-around, for the wai-aria features, which would allow for native handling of the regular editor component are not yet fully implemented by Chrome Electron.</li>
